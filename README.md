# Wireshark-Packet-Analysis-
In this project, I analyze network packets and protocols such as HTTP, TCP, and UDP using Wireshark. The goal is to detect any abnormal activities within network traffic. I will be using capture samples from SampleCapture-Wireshark to perform detailed analysis and provide insights into network behavior.
